# OandaCache

    OandaCache was written for the purpose of Caching Oanda's REST candles offline.

    The application allows access to these candles in their original JSON format.
    One candle per line (newline denominated "\n")

# Future

    I would like to incorporate reloading the executable, or rescanning directory.
    In this way the user could specify which repositary to load on demand.

    Now its fire and forget.

   Enjoy
